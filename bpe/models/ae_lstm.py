Architecture inspired by Section 3.5 and Fig. 8:
    Encoder LSTM  : PPG sequence (B, L, 1) → latent vector (B, hidden_size)
                    via final hidden state of a single LSTM layer + Dropout
    Decoder LSTM  : latent → expand to (B, L, hidden_size) → LSTM →
                    Linear(1) → reconstructed PPG (B, 1, L)
    BP Head       : Linear(hidden_size, 32) → ReLU → Linear(32, 2)
                    regression head adapted for continuous [SBP, DBP]

    The paper describes an Autoencoder-LSTM with LSTM encoder/decoder
    and reconstruction-error minimization, but does not provide full
    implementation details such as latent construction, decoder input,
    or reconstruction/regression loss weighting.

Hyperparameters from Table 1:
    hidden_size : 100  (paper Table 1)
    dropout     : 0.2
    recon_weight: 0.2  (paper does not specify; prioritize BP regression)

Adaptations for VitalDB:
    * Input: 1,000-sample PPG segments (8 s @ 125 Hz); paper uses 256 Hz wrist PPG.
    * Output: [SBP, DBP] scalar regression (mmHg) instead of paper's 3-class
      BP classification with SoftMax + cross-entropy.
    * BP head: replaced the paper's classification layer with a small 2-layer
      regression MLP (100 → 32 → 2) because this project predicts continuous BP.
    * Optimizer: Adam (paper uses SGDM; project-standard optimizer).
    * Loss: MSE/Huber for both reconstruction and BP regression.
    * Reconstruction weighting: reduced to 0.2 so BP estimation remains the
      primary objective during training.
    * The combined multi-task loss mirrors the MTAE convention used in this project:
          loss = (1 − recon_weight) * bp_loss + recon_weight * recon_loss

    """Autoencoder-LSTM for cuffless BP estimation from PPG signals.

    An LSTM encoder compresses the full PPG waveform into a latent vector
    by processing the signal as a time series and retaining the final hidden
    state.  A decoder LSTM reconstructs the original signal from this latent
    representation as a self-supervised auxiliary task, which improves the
    encoder's feature quality.  The paper describes a classification layer with
    SoftMax/cross-entropy, but this project targets continuous SBP/DBP
    regression, so the latent vector is passed through a small 2-layer MLP
    head instead.

    The combined loss used during training::

        loss = (1 - recon_weight) * bp_loss + recon_weight * recon_loss

    Args:
        hidden_size:   LSTM hidden units. Default: 100 to match the paper.
        dropout:       Dropout probability applied to the encoder output.
                       Default: 0.2 (paper Table 1).
        seq_len:       Input/output sequence length (samples).  Default: 1000
                       (8 s @ 125 Hz as used by this project).
        recon_weight:  Reconstruction-loss weight in [0, 1]. Default: 0.2 to
                       prioritize BP regression over waveform reconstruction.
        out_features:  Output dimension — 2 for [SBP, DBP].  Default: 2.
